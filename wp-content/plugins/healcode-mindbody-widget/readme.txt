== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are MINDBODY Widgets? =

[Sign up for MINDBODY!](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/branded-web-tools "Sign up for MINDBODY!")

= How do I add a MINDBODY Widget? =

See our [MINDBODY Widget Plugin FAQ](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/article/ka032000000LBlAAAW/Putting-widgets-on-WordPress-com-branded-web-tools-formerly-HealCode?language=en_US)

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/117301143]

= Where do I find my MINDBODY Widget code? =

You can find the code for each Widget in its control panel in the MINDBODY Branded Web Manager. You can login [here](https://manager.healcode.com/users/sign_in "here").

= If I make changes to the Widget, will I need to reinstall the shortcode or copy the Widget code again? =

No, you will only need to create the Widget shortcode once. The exceptions to this are if the shortcode is deleted from your WordPress Admin area or if you create a new website.

= My Widgets are already installed, do I need this plugin? =

You do not **need** the plugin, but we recommend that you use it. The plugin makes it easier for you to manage pages on which Widgets are installed.

Want to switch to the plugin? Install a Widget using the plugin on a test page before you delete anything, if you prefer the plugin, you will need to delete your previous Widgets from your website and replace them with the plugin shortcodes.

You can find instructions for installing a Widget with the plugin [here](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/article/ka032000000LBaWAAW/Putting-widgets-on-WordPress-ORG-using-shortcodes-generated-by-a-plugin-Branded-web-healcode?language=en_US).

= How are these Widgets different from my current MINDBODY Widgets? =

These are exactly the same Widgets that you are currently using. They are just installed differently.

= Is there another way to install the Widgets to my WordPress website? =

Yes, see our FAQ [here](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/article/ka032000000LBlAAAW/Putting-widgets-on-WordPress-com-branded-web-tools-formerly-HealCode?language=en_US).

= Does this plugin work with the Fusion Builder plugin? =

Yes. You can use it within a text box.

= What if the MINDBODY Widget is not working properly? =

Please check the WordPress version you are using. Make sure it meets the minimum version recommended by us. Make sure all files of the `healcode_mindbody_widget` plugin are uploaded to the folder `wp-content/plugins/`

Also, if you have updated the Widget Title for any Widget shortcodes, you will need to re-add the shortcode to your page, post, or WordPress widget. This is because changing the Widget Title changes the shortcode itself.

= What if I have 2 MINDBODY Widgets placed adjacently, but only one of them works? =

Please use a whitespace to separate 2 shortcodes.
